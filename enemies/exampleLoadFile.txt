//everything starting with // is a comment and doesn't show what should be in the text file
//everything indented is the format of the document - there is an example at the bottom
//split into 4 sections, section one is dialogue it takes the following format:
  Line of speech, Speaker
//note you can't use commas in the actual line of speech so be creative with your punctuation
//each line is one of the boxes shown on screen ie each time you press q it will move to the next Line
//once you are done with the dialogue give the keyword:
  Enemies
//this tells the program to move on to loading Enemies
//each line represents an enemy and takes the following format
  xposition, yposition, health, project path to movingleftsprite, number of columns on the previous sprite, project path to moving right sprite, number of columns in previous sprite, type of enemy
//there are several different modes:
//d: dynamic, this is a moving enemy
//s: static, this enemy doesn't change relative xposition
//bm: mario boss
//bd: doom boss
//once you are done with the enemies use the keyword:
  Walls
//Each line represents an object, it is not necessarily a wall so things like stairs, flagpoles etc are in this section
//each line takes the following format
  project path to image, x position, y position, collidable
//the collidable field can be one of two things:
// 0 collidable
// 1 non collidable - mainly used for things like the flagpole and castle that we should have put in the background but didn't
//once you are done with that, use the keyword:
  Floor
//this tells the program to move onto the final section: loading the Floor
//each floor platform takes the following format
  project path to image, x position, 557
//557 is the y position and is constant -DON'T CHANGE IT
//if there is just one floor platform, you can set the xposition to "mid"

//things to note:
//all x and y positions are for the centre of the images so take that into account

//example
This is a line of dialogue, Speaker one
This is another line of dialogue from a different speaker, Speaker two
